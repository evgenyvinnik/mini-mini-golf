Copied code from here: https://github.com/Antix-Development/Putt-Till-You-Die/
made the game shittier but smaller.

## Gameplay

The aim is to putt the ball into the goal. That's prety much it.

Easy to operate:
- Hold and move the left mouse button to aim, a longer line means more putt power.
- Press space key to cancel aiming.
- Release the left mouse button to make your putt.
- Hold the shift key to show your statistics.
